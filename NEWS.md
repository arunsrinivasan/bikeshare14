### v0.1.2

1. Fixed duration units from 'minutes' to 'seconds' in documentation.

2. The old link to Bay Area Bike Share (below) does not function anymore. The service now seems to be called "Ford GoBike" and the open data seems to be available only from 2017 on from [here](https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data).

### v0.1.0

#### NEW FEATURES

1. Added Bay Area bike share anonymised trips along with `weather` and `station` metadata for the year 2014. Source: http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/open-data.
